# Rock_Paper_Scissor-Game
In this project, we will see how we can create a rock paper and scissor game using Tkinter. Rock paper scissor is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of the three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are “rock”, “paper”, and “scissors”.
